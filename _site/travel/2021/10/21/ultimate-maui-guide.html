    <p>Want to travel Maui like a local?&nbsp; Well we&rsquo;ve got you covered!&nbsp; While we can&rsquo;t call ourselves locals, we did live in Maui for 6 months and know all the best places to hike, snorkel and eat!&nbsp; Maui is one of the most incredible places to visit with such diverse landscapes, your adventure options are truly endless.&nbsp; We recommend visiting for at least a week to truly get the Hawaiian experience.&nbsp;</p><p><em>* Hawaii is a special place with rich history and culture.&nbsp; Please be very respectful of the people and land while visiting, and always leave places better than you found it!</em></p><p>There is so much to see on the Island of Maui, so I will split it up into sections so that it's easier to digest.&nbsp; At the end of this post you can find a 10 day itinerary to make the planning easier for you!</p>

    <h3><strong>North Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paia is dubbed the hippie town of Maui and it consists of cool shops, great places to eat and beautiful beaches.&nbsp; On Paia&rsquo;s main street you will find many shops filled with jewelry, beachwear and art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best Restaurants:</strong></h4><ul><li><p><em><strong>Mama&rsquo;s Fish house -</strong></em> Ready to drop some $$$ on the best meal of your life?&nbsp; Mama&rsquo;s Fish house is the best place to be.&nbsp; Great vibes and even better food, just make sure you get a reservation well in advance!</p></li><li><em><strong>Paia Fish Market-</strong> </em>The best fish tacos you will ever have! Perfect for a quick bite at any time of the day.&nbsp; There is also a location in Lahaina and Kihei if you can&rsquo;t get enough on your trip to Paia!</li><li><em><strong>Polli&rsquo;s Mexican Restaurant-</strong></em> Okay not technically in Paia, but its only a 10 min drive and so worth it for the best Mexican on the island! Its so authentic that you can expect to see waiters chasing the islands famous roosters out the door every few minutes!&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Ululani's Hawaiian Shaved ice-</strong></em> Maybe not exactly a meal but this tasty treat is a must while you&rsquo;re in Hawaii.&nbsp; Try flavors unique to Hawaii like lychee and Lilikoi with their incredible Mochi on top! There are many locations on the island and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll need to get your fix more than once during your trip!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best Beaches:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Ho&rsquo;okipa -</strong></em> This is the perfect place to see turtles (Please keep at least a 10 foot distance between you and a turtle!&nbsp; It's actually illegal to touch or come close to turtles in Hawaii!) Also check out the overlook to watch surfers ride some pretty crazy waves!</li><li><em><strong>Baldwin Beach -</strong></em> Turquoise waters and absolutely incredible views of the lush mountains of the Central Coast! Also a great place to watch kite surfers!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best Shops:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Alice in HulaLand- </strong></em>This quirky shop has the best clothes!</li><li><em><strong>Ho&rsquo;okipa Surf- </strong></em>The best shirts!&nbsp; Matt got so many cool shirts and hats here that are great quality and colors!</li><li><em><strong>Tribe Maui-</strong></em> If you went to Polli's Mexican restaurant, make sure you stop in this store that's across the street. This boutique has my favorite unique jewelry and clothes!</li></ul>

    <h3><strong>East Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The famous road to Hana!&nbsp; If you have a 4x4 vehicle there are technically three ways to do the road to Hana.&nbsp; You can (1) start by Paia and go to Hana and back, (2) Start by Paia go all the way around and end up on the south side of Maui, or (3) start on the south side go to Hana and back.&nbsp; My personal favorite is the last option because I get pretty car sick, but if it's your first time you really should try to go all the way around to experience the full beauty of this ride!&nbsp; Note: rental cars do not insure you if you take the Southside way to Hana because you are mostly on a dirt road and it can get a little sketchy.&nbsp; We took our 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee on the road many, many times and it handled the roads, and turns just fine! This road isn't for the faint of heart though with its many hair pin and cliffside turns.&nbsp; If you go slow and stay very aware of cars around you, you will be just fine! Also let locals pass, as they will be used to the roads and going much faster!</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re starting from Paia make sure to download the &ldquo;Road to Hana Maui GyPSy Guide'' in the app store.&nbsp; It tells you where to stop, how long each stop might be and gives you history along the way!&nbsp; It's about $5 and so worth it for all the information you get.&nbsp; There are so many turns it's easy to pass up some pretty incredible spots if you don't have it.&nbsp; Just make sure you download the app before you take the drive because you will lose service along the way.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><strong>South Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We lived in Kihei so we might be a little biased to this side, but there are so many amazing beaches and places to eat that we fell in love!</p><h4><strong>Best Restaurants:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Maui Brewing- </strong></em>Incredible beers with an amazing outdoor seating area.&nbsp; Try to come here at sunset!</li><li><em><strong>Isana- </strong></em>Our favorite sushi in the whole wide world!

    <h4><strong>Best Beaches:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Makena Beach (Big Beach) - </strong></em>If you make it to any beach on this side of the island, make it this one!&nbsp; Better yet come here for sunset and you will not be disappointed.&nbsp; Word from an over cautious nurse- the waves here are STRONG.&nbsp; Please never turn your back on the ocean and be careful while boogie boarding or body surfing.&nbsp; The waves are known to slam you into the beach and if you don't know what you're doing you could get very hurt or paralyzed.&nbsp; Trust me I saw it at the hospital.&nbsp; So just be smart and have fun!&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Little Beach (Nude Beach) -</strong></em> This is a fully nude beach that is incredibly beautiful, but if you're not into nudity do not venture over here.&nbsp; To get here from the big beach, go to the far right side (if you're looking at the ocean) and climb over the dividing rocks.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Makena Secret Cove- </strong></em>Not much of a secret anymore, and it shows because it's constantly packed!&nbsp; But if you can find a spot it's so worth it!</li><li><em><strong>Kamaole park I,II &amp; III-</strong></em> most locals have their favorite, check out all three and let me know your favorite!</li></ul>

You will see tons of fish and even some sea turtles! Always remember to wear Reef Safe sunscreen as we want to keep the reefs healthy and vibrant!

You can start these trips from Maalaea Harbor or Lahaina Harbor.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Honolua Bay- </strong></em>Walk through a literal fairytale land of banyan trees to a perfect snorkeling bay.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Dragon's Teeth- </strong></em>Nice half mile walk along the ocean to see a cool lava flow formation that looks like jagged dragon teeth! Parking for the hike is from a parking lot off of office road, next to the Maui Pineapple Chapel.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Surfing- </strong></em>This is a great area to try surfing for the first time.&nbsp; I do recommend starting with a trainer as surfing is hard to learn on your own and you don't want to take on waves that are too big for you!&nbsp; Launiupoko is a great place to learn! (pro tip: stay out of the way of other surfers if you don't want to get yelled at!) Another great area is anywhere along the Honoapiilani Highway past Olowala Beach area. Youll see people pulled over and surfing wherever they see waves!</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Mala Wharf-</strong></em> If you opted out of taking a trip to Molokini, you can still reach &ldquo;turtle town&rdquo; by car! Park at the wharf and swim out to the sunken wharf to see turtles and coral!&nbsp; Caution: do not attempt this if you are not a strong swimmer!&nbsp; There is a decent current here and it's a little ways out to reach the coral! Take a life jacket or choose to snorkel with a tour if you are unsure.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <h3><strong>Central:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Iao Valley (Pronounced EE-ow) - </strong></em>This is a must stop for its beautiful scenery and interesting historical events.&nbsp; I suggest parking in the large parking lot at the very top of the hill and doing the short hike up to the viewpoint of the Iao needle.&nbsp; From there you can walk down the path to the river and if the water is calm you can lounge in the various pools that are created in the river.&nbsp; If you go back down to the parking lot, you will see many small paths cut into the trees where you can walk out to other calm pools.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Waihee Ridge trail- </strong></em>This is a 4 Mile trail that offers gorgeous views of the ridge-line and the ocean.&nbsp; It is rated as hard due to its steep climb in some places. If you're not up to this milage, there is a viewpoint halfway that's absolutely breathtaking.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Olivine Pools-</strong></em> *Please only visit if the ocean is calm, and never turn your back to the ocean!*&nbsp; People have been pulled out to the ocean and have even died here, so please use your common sense and do not go close if there are waves crashing into the pools. Even if it&rsquo;s a calm day, always face the ocean and stay away from the edges just in case. That being said, on calm days this is one of the coolest spots to see tide pools and jump into crystal clear pools carved out by the ocean.&nbsp; You are going to park in a red dirt area off the side of Kahekili Highway.&nbsp; It's best to type in &ldquo;Olivine Pools'' into google maps and be on the lookout for a dirt parking area.&nbsp; From the parking lot, take the short and steep hike down to the pools.&nbsp; There isn't a clear cut path, but you should usually see people down below and make your way towards them. The lava rock makes a very cool and beautiful landscape to view on the way down.&nbsp; Bring sturdy shoes and water shoes to change into as the rocks at the bottom will be slippery.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <h3><strong>Upcountry:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Haleakala National Park - </strong></em>You&rsquo;re not going to want to miss this one of a kind experience.&nbsp; Make sure you book a sunrise reservation way in advance as it fills up quickly.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s so worth it to go for sunrise, although sunset is equally as beautiful if you are unable to get a reservation in time. Click&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/facility/253731">here</a> to book a reservation.&nbsp; Make sure you bring a hat, gloves, and coat with you as it is around 40 degrees. Get to the lookout points early as they fill up and you want to have a great view of the sun peaking out throughout the clouds for the first time! If you have time after sunrise, hike the sliding sands trail for views that make you feel like you're on mars!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best Restaurants:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Kula Bistro-</strong></em> All day cafe that has the best food and sweets! You're not going to want to miss out on their amazing case of baked goods&nbsp; filled with pies, cakes and other yummy treats.&nbsp; Trust me, if you&rsquo;re anything like me you will have trouble picking just one to take home!</li><li><em><strong>Bullies Burgers-</strong></em> Small shop on the way to Hana (If you're going the back way). They sell their all beef burgers from their cattle ranch and it is delicious!</li><li><em><strong>Maui Wine - </strong></em>Have you ever had pineapple wine?&nbsp; Try the pineapple flight here along with so many other delicious selections in a beautiful setting.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <p>**Driving around both ends of the island (Hana, and the opposite coast) are a little treacherous in areas.&nbsp; The roads are built on the side of cliffs so they might seem scary to some.&nbsp; I had absolutely no issues driving either of these roads, but just wanted to point out to you that they might seem scary if you&rsquo;re not used to driving tight, hilly roads. Go slow and pull off to the side to let any locals pass who might be pushing you past your comfort zone!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Check out rentals that offer roof top tents.&nbsp; That way you can have a car and a place to sleep all in one!</p>
