            <p>The Grand Tetons are one of my very favorite National Parks
            because the views of the peaks are so magnificent!&nbsp; There is so
            much to do and see that you could probably spend weeks here, but if
            you're short on time this is the must do's in the area!</p><p>Grab
            your hiking boots and your camera because there's so much to
            see!</p>

            <p>Day One: Drive into the Tetons National Park early and head
            straight to the Taggart Lake TrailHead. There are a few ways you can
            make this a shorter hike, and I will list them all
            here:&nbsp;</p><p>The hike we did is from Taggart Lake to Delta
            Lake.&nbsp; This hike is rated difficult and is 12.8 miles.&nbsp; It
            is easy until you get to the last 2 miles where there is a 2,000 ft
            elevation gain. I know this sounds difficult, but trust me the views
            from the top are WORTH IT!&nbsp; Start this hike from the Taggart
            Lake Trailhead, and follow the trail for about 2 miles until you get
            to the first lake, Taggart lake.&nbsp; Make sure you snap some
            pictures of the beautiful crystal clear water with mountain peaks
            surrounding! It's stunning!</p>

            <p>From there you will continue on to Bradley lake that is also just
            as beautiful.&nbsp; (There is also a path to bypass Taggart Lake and
            go on to Bradley lake if you want to make it a little
            shorter)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Now we will continue on to the harder section of this hike.&nbsp;
            You will come to a series of switchbacks for about a mile and a
            half.&nbsp; Be on the lookout for a fork in the trail, because you
            will want to take a set of stairs down to the right to find Delta
            Lake.&nbsp; The trail is not well marked and it could be easy to
            miss!&nbsp; Now starts the really challenging part!</p>

            <p>You will be questioning, &ldquo;Is this really the trail?!&rdquo;
            As you climb over boulders and feel like you're literally climbing
            up the side of a mountain!&nbsp; Just keep going, I promise you will
            make it to the top and it will be so worth it!&nbsp; You did it, you
            made it to the beautiful turquoise lake that is Delta Lake! Take a
            break in the sun on one of the many rocks and eat your snack.&nbsp;
            You deserve it!</p>

            <p>Another way to go that is shorter, but you miss the two beautiful
            lakes at the bottom, is by starting at Lupine Meadows.&nbsp; By
            starting at this trailhead, you will be shaving off 5 miles.&nbsp;
            On the way down you will definitely thank yourself, but you also
            miss a lot of the beauty along the way! If you're short on time,
            choose this option so you don't miss Delta Lake!</p>

            <p>After a long day of hiking, set up camp at antelope
            springs.&nbsp; This is a free camping area with marked campsites
            that you can stay in for a maximum of 5 days.&nbsp; We arrived late
            one night and had trouble finding a spot, but luckily we were able
            to double up with a kind neighbor.&nbsp; The next day we were able
            to move to an open spot of our own when someone left. If you have
            time in the morning, we would encourage you to stop here before the
            hike so that you can ensure that you have a spot to come home
            to!</p>

            <p>Another dispersed camping area that is beautiful and has a large
            RV parking area in the front (Just in case all the spots are taken,
            you know you'll have somewhere to stay!) is Spread Creek.&nbsp; We
            stayed here on our first night while in the Tetons, but found it was
            farther away from the things we wanted to do, so then we moved to
            Antelope Springs.</p>

            <p>Day 2: Start the day off early with Sunrise at Mormon Row.&nbsp;
            Make sure you get to Mormon Row before the run rises so you can get
            a good spot for picture taking at this famous spot.&nbsp; It becomes
            very crowded here, and if you're anything like me, you don't want a
            picture of peoples heads!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Once the sun has risen, take a little walk around the area to
            take in the history of the area.&nbsp; The Homestead Act of 1862
            allowed people to migrate to the area to set up homesteads in
            exchange for 160 acres of land.&nbsp; Mormon settlers from Salt Lake
            City made the trek out to the area to cultivate the land, and now
            the 6 structures that are left are called &ldquo;Mormon
            Row&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>From here you will drive the 42 mile scenic loop to the many
            stunning viewpoints to see the best views in the park! I would
            recommend doing the loop clockwise so that you can end at the snake
            river for Sunset.&nbsp;</p><p>Head back to camp at antelope
            springs.</p>

            <p>Day 3:&nbsp;</p><p>Are you ready for another early hike?&nbsp;
            This time we are starting at Jenny Lake and hiking to Lake
            Solitude.&nbsp; This hike is also rated difficult, mostly for the
            length, and is 18 miles round trip.&nbsp; I highly recommend taking
            the Jenny Lake Ferry across the lake and shaving off 2 miles each
            way (4 miles total). The ferry shuttle runs about every 10-15
            minutes and tickets can be purchased at the East Boat Dock at $10.00
            for one way or $18.00 round trip for adults.&nbsp; During the off
            season, the shuttle only runs from 10 - 4:30pm (so make sure you
            plan to start your hike early so that you make it back in time to
            catch the last one.&nbsp; If you don't make it back, no worries,
            you'll just have to hike an extra 2 miles to get back to the Jenny
            Lake parking area.&nbsp; Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"

            website</a> to find the cost and schedule (in the bottom right
