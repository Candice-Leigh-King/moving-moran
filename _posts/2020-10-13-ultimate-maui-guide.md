            <p>Want to travel Maui like a local?&nbsp; Well we&rsquo;ve got you
            covered!&nbsp; While we can&rsquo;t call ourselves locals, we did
            live in Maui for 6 months and know all the best places to hike,
            snorkel and eat!&nbsp; Maui is one of the most incredible places to
            visit with such diverse landscapes, your adventure options are truly
            endless.&nbsp; We recommend visiting for at least a week to truly
            get the Hawaiian experience.&nbsp;</p><p>* Hawaii is a special place
            with rich history and culture.&nbsp; Please be very respectful of
            the people and land while visiting, and always leave the land better
            than you found it!</p><p>There is so much to see on the Island of
            Maui, but to make it easier I will split it up into sections so that
            it's easier to digest.&nbsp; At the end of this post you can find a
            7 day itinerary to make the planning easier for you!</p>

            <p><strong>North Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Paia is dubbed the
            hippie town of Maui and it consists of cool shops, great places to
            eat and beautiful beaches.&nbsp; On Paia&rsquo;s main street you
            will find many shops filled with jewelry, beachwear and
            art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best
            Restaurants:</strong></p><ol><li>Mama&rsquo;s Fish house - Ready to
            drop some $$$ on the best meal of your life?&nbsp; Mama&rsquo;s Fish
            house is the best place to be.&nbsp; Great vibes and even better
            food, just make sure you get a reservation well in
            advance!</li><li>Paia Fish Market- The best fish tacos you will ever
            have! Perfect for a quick bite at any time of the day.&nbsp; There
            is also a location in Lahaina and Kihei if you can&rsquo;t get
            enough on your trip to Paia!</li><li>Polli&rsquo;s Mexican
            Restaurant- Okay not technically in Paia, but its only a 10 min
            drive and so worth it for the best Mexican on the island! Its so
            authentic that you can expect to see waiters chasing the islands
            famous roosters out the door every few
            minutes!&nbsp;</li><li>Ululani's Hawaiian Shaved ice- Maybe not
            exactly a meal but this tasty treat is a must while you&rsquo;re in
            Hawaii.&nbsp; Try flavors unique to Hawaii like lychee and Lilikoi
            with their incredible Mochi on top! There are many locations on the
            island and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll need to get your fix more
            than once during your trip!</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best
            Beaches:</strong></p><ol><li>Ho&rsquo;okipa - This is the perfect
            place to see turtles (Please keep at least a 10 foot distance
            between you and a turtle!&nbsp; It's actually illegal to touch or
            come close to turtles in Hawaii!) Also check out the overlook to
            watch surfers ride some pretty crazy waves!</li><li>Baldwin Beach -
            Turquoise waters and absolutely incredible views of the lush
            mountains of the Central Coast! Also a great place to watch kite
            surfers!</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best
            Shops:</strong></p><ol><li>Alice in HulaLand- This quirky shop has
            the best clothes!</li><li>Ho&rsquo;okipa Surf- The best
            shirts!&nbsp; Matt got so many cool shirts and hats here that are
            great quality and colors!</li><li>Tribe Maui- If you went to Polli's
            Mexican restaurant, make sure you stop in this store that's across
            the street. This boutique has my favorite unique jewelry and
            clothes!</li></ol>

            <p><strong>East Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The famous road to
            Hana!&nbsp; If you have a 4x4 vehicle there are technically three
            ways to do the road to Hana.&nbsp; You can (1) start by Paia and go
            to Hana and back, (2) Start by Paia go all the way around and end up
            on the south side of Maui, or (3) start on the south side go to Hana
            and back.&nbsp; My personal favorite is the last option because I
            get pretty car sick, but if it's your first time you really should
            try to go all the way around to experience the full beauty of this
            ride!&nbsp; Note: rental cars do not insure you if you take the
            Southside way to Hana because you are mostly on a dirt road and it
            can get a little sketchy.&nbsp; We took our 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee
            on the road many, many times and it handled the roads, and turns
            just fine! This road isn't for the faint of heart though with its
            many hair pin and cliffside turns.&nbsp; If you go slow and stay
            very aware of cars around you, you will be just fine! Also let
            locals pass, as they will be used to the roads and going much
            faster!</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re starting from Paia make sure to download the
            &ldquo;Road to Hana Maui GyPSy Guide'' in the app store.&nbsp; It
            tells you where to stop, how long each stop might be and gives you
            history along the way!&nbsp; It's about $5 and so worth it for all
            the information you get.&nbsp; There are so many turns it's easy to
            pass up some pretty incredible spots if you don't have it.&nbsp;
            Just make sure you download the app before you take the drive
            because you will lose service along the way.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Some of our favorite places to stop along the way (in the order
            that you will pass):</p><ol><li>Twin Falls&nbsp;</li><li>Garden of
            Eden Arboretum&nbsp;</li><li>Halfway to Hana Stand</li><li>Upper
            Waikani Fall: Swimming area with 3 waterfalls</li><li>Pua&rsquo;a
            Ka&rsquo;a State Wayside Park- great place to have a picnic, use the
            restroom and enjoy another waterfall and swimming
            area.&nbsp;</li><li>There are too many waterfalls on this drive to
            name, so if you see something cool, safely pull over and check them
            out!</li><li>Hana Lava Tube ( Mile Marker 31) Turn Left on
            Ula&rsquo;ino road to check out the coolest lava tube!&nbsp; Make
            sure you bring your flash lights!</li></ol>

            if you can spend the night in Hana you can make the most of your
            trip! Check out the many yummy food trucks for
            dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>10. Koki Beach- A gorgeous red-ish sand beach

            <p>11. Venus Ponds- A must stop in my opninion! A short trail down
            to a secluded swimming area off of the ocean.&nbsp; You can cliff
            jump here and the water is clear and and so refreshing!</p>

            <p>12. Wailua Falls- Pull off on the side of the road in the many
            parking spaces.&nbsp; You can see the falls from the road, or take
            the short path to a pool area where you can jump in!</p>

            <p>13. The Pools of Phe&rsquo;o and Pipiwai trail- My favorite hike
            on all of Maui!&nbsp; Do not miss this stop!&nbsp; Check out the
            pools and then go on this 4 mile hike to the 400 foot Waimoku Falls
            through an increible bamboo forest.&nbsp; Trust me, its one of the
            coolest hikes Ive ever been on with multiple waterfalls along the
            way!</p>

            <p><strong>South Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>We lived in Kihei so we
            might be a little biased to this side, but there are so many amazing
            beaches and places to eat that we fell in love!</p><p><strong>Best
            Restaurants:</strong></p><ol><li>Maui Brewing- Incredible beers with
            an amazing outdoor seating area.&nbsp; Try to come here at
            sunset!</li><li>Isana- Our favorite sushi in the whole wide world!
            Please just do us a favor and go here.&nbsp; And don't forget a
            reservation! Check out Happy hour for 40% off select sushi and
            drinks from 3-5pm and 9-10pm daily.&nbsp;</li><li>South Shore Tiki
            Bar-&nbsp; This was our favorite spot to hang out! Great tiki drinks
            and Pizza in a cute atmosphere!</li><li>Food trucks off of Piikea
            Ave- A fun area to come if no one can decide on what they
            want.&nbsp; Come here and choose from several food trucks and then
            meet at the picnic tables as a family!</li><li>5 Palms- This is a
            more expensive dinner, but the views and food are worth it!&nbsp;
            Take a nice walk on the beach before or after
            dinner.&nbsp;</li></ol>

            <p><strong>Best Beaches:</strong></p><ol><li>Makena Beach (Big
            Beach) - If you make it to any beach on this side of the island,
            make it this one!&nbsp; Better yet come here for sunset and you will
            not be disappointed.&nbsp; Word from an over cautious nurse- the
            waves here are STRONG.&nbsp; Please never turn your back on the
            ocean and be careful while boogie boarding or body surfing.&nbsp;
            The waves are known to slam you into the beach and if you don't know
            what you're doing you could get very hurt or paralyzed.&nbsp; Trust
            me I saw it at the hospital.&nbsp; So just be smart and have
            fun!&nbsp;</li><li>Little Beach (NUDE BEACH) - This is a fully nude
            beach that is incredibly beautiful, but if you're not into nudity do
            not venture over here.&nbsp; To get here from the big beach, go to
            the far right side (if you're looking at the ocean) and climb over
            the dividing rocks.&nbsp;</li><li>Makena Secret Cove- Not much of a
            secret anymore, and it shows because it's constantly packed!&nbsp;
            But if you can find a spot it's so worth it!</li><li>Kamaole park
            I,II &amp; III- most locals have their favorite, check out all three
            and let me know your favorite!</li></ol>

            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p><ol><li>La Perouse Bay and Lava
            Field hike - Rent some snorkel gear from Snorkel Bob&rsquo;s in
            Kihei for the day and head out to La Perouse bay for some amazing
            snorkeling! You will see tons of fish and even some sea turtles!
            Always remember to wear Reef Safe sunscreen as we want to keep the
            reefs healthy and vibrant! Afterwards, head down the road a bit to
            the Lava Fields hike along the ocean.&nbsp; It's truly a unique
            experience!</li></ol>

            <p>2. Day trip to Molokini- There are so many options for half day
            or full day boat trips to the molokini crater.&nbsp; The snorkeling
            is incredible and it's so fun to sail around on a catamaran!&nbsp;
            If you have time for a longer trip, I suggest booking one that also
            goes to &ldquo;turtle town&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is the Mala Wharf on
            the Westside of Maui and you are guaranteed to see many turtles
            because the turtles come here to have fish eat the algae off their
            shells and flippers, kind of like a turtle car wash!</p>

            <p>2. Dragon's Teeth- Nice half mile walk along the ocean to see a
            cool lava flow formation that looks like jagged dragon teeth!
            Parking for the hike is from a parking lot off of office road, next
            to the Maui Pineapple Chapel.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Surfing- This is a
            great area to try surfing for the first time.&nbsp; I do recommend
            starting with a trainer as surfing is hard to learn on your own and
            you don't want to take on waves that are too big for you!&nbsp;
            Launiupoko is a great place to learn! (pro tip: stay out of the way
            of other surfers if you don't want to get yelled at!)</p>

            <p>Mala Wharf- If you opted out of taking a trip to Molokini, you
            can still reach &ldquo;turtle town&rdquo; by car! Park at the wharf
            and swim out to the sunken wharf to see turtles and coral!&nbsp;
            Caution: do not attempt this if you are not a strong swimmer!&nbsp;
            There is a decent current here and it's a little ways out to reach
            the coral!. Take a life jacket or choose to snorkel with a tour if
            you are unsure.&nbsp;</p>
