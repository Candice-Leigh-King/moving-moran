      <h1><strong>Waipio Valley to Waimanu
      Valley</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to be far away
      from the crowds of Waipio Valley and experience the untouched beauty of
      Hawaii, then Waimanu Valley should be on your bucket list! Before the
      tsunami of 1949, Waimanu Valley was a thriving community of fishermen and
      farmers who lived off the land.&nbsp; Today, it is the most remote part of
      the island and is only accessible by foot or boat. This beautiful black
      sand beach is a must see for all those looking to escape the hustle and
      bustle of daily life.</p>

      <h1><strong>What to expect:</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Immerse yourself
      in the magic that is the Waimanu Valley at this incredibly beautiful
      beachfront camping oasis. Before you begin you want to make sure you
      secure a campsite reservation at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,31720.html">Hawaii
      Camping</a>. You&rsquo;ll need to create an account and bring a copy of
      the permit reservation with you. (A screenshot on your phone is okay too!)
      A campsite will cost $18 a night and there is a primitive toilet at the
      site.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This hike technically starts at the top of the Waipio Valley.&nbsp; We
      planned on driving to the bottom of the hill and starting our hike at the
      beach, but the security guard cautioned us on leaving our car at the beach
      overnight saying it would be &ldquo;asking for trouble&rdquo;.&nbsp; We
      decided tacking on the extra 3 miles both ways was better than getting
      broken into and parked on the road before the Waipio Valley Overlook. We
      also heard that you can pay a fee to leave your car at the Waipio Valley
      Artworks for a few days, but since we found parking on the street we
      didn't need to pay.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If there&rsquo;s anything you take from this post it's to bring hiking
      poles on this trip! By starting at the top of Waipio Valley you will be
      hiking a total of 19 miles with three 3,500 foot climbs.&nbsp; So be
      prepared!&nbsp; Hopefully some kind soul will drive you up to the top on
      your way back out, but you can&rsquo;t count on it.&nbsp; Luckily, someone
      picked us up 3/4th of the way back up the hill, and I don&rsquo;t think I
      have ever been so thankful for a ride in my life! Check out our
      Backpacking guide <a
      href="/travel/tips/2020/10/13/what-we-pack-for-our-backpacking-trips.html">here</a>
      to know exactly what to pack for this overnight hike!</p>

      <p>To start the Muliwai Trail hike you will go down the paved road for 3
      miles into Waipio valley.&nbsp; Here you will cross over your first river
      crossing and continue on to the trail through the woods to the other cliff
      side.&nbsp; Once you reach the other side you will immediately start your
      3500 ft climb over 1 mile to the top.&nbsp; This climb isn&rsquo;t so bad
      because it is well maintained, but it is a very tight, steep path.&nbsp;
      Stop about halfway up at the turn in the switch back for a stunning view
      of Waipio Valley. Don&rsquo;t get too close to the edge, but enjoy the
      views here and take some pictures! This is the most you&rsquo;ll be seeing
      of the coast for the next few hours. I was hoping that once you make it up
      the cliff it would flatten out and the hardest part would be over.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, this is not really the case as you will be going up and
      down valleys and over small waterfall crossings for miles.&nbsp; Be extra
      cautious when crossing streams or waterfalls as these are all areas where
      flash floods can happen at any moment.</p>

      <p>Congrats, you have now made it over to the other side and you see a
      glimpse of the campsite!&nbsp; At this point you will be so excited to
      finally be going downhill, but this part is almost harder than going up!
      This side is completely unmaintained and is covered by fallen tree
      branches and loose rocks that you will slip on constantly.&nbsp; It was
      very slow going down this side because it is so steep and slippery, so be
      careful and take your time! &nbsp;</p>

      <p>We safely made it down the mountain and into camp with one last
      obstacle in our way.&nbsp; You have one more river crossing to make.&nbsp;
      You can cross through the middle which is deep but has a rope tied across
      to help, or you can do what we did and cross at the rocks.&nbsp; There is
      about a 30 foot Crossing in-between the two rock walls that is fairly easy
      to cross.&nbsp; Just go slow because the water is moving quickly and the
      rocks are slippery under your feet.&nbsp; Poles come in handy at this
      point to help stabilize yourself!</p>

      <h2><strong>The campsite</strong></h2><p>You have made it to the gorgeous
      Waimanu Valley!&nbsp; Take it all in, it truly is breathtaking.&nbsp;
      There are 9 campsites spread out along the beach.&nbsp; We arrived later
      in the day, so most of the campsites had been taken, so we chose spot
      #5.&nbsp; It was probably not the best campsite out of all of them, but
      it's close to the toilets and honestly any spot on this beach is a good
      one! Spot #2 has a gorgeous view of the valley and is a large campsite
      suitable for larger groups.&nbsp; Our favorite campsite was #8 because it
      was like someone had made it their own personal oasis.&nbsp; It comes with
      a rock lounger, swing and path out to the beach!&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Once you are at the campsite you will probably be in need of a water
      refill.&nbsp; Refrain from taking water from the stream, and instead take
      a five minute walk to some clean(er) water.&nbsp; To get to the water
      source follow the path to campsite 9.&nbsp; At this point there will be a
      sign telling you not to go any further, but we were instructed by other
      people at camp to continue past it onto the rock path along the
      cliffside.&nbsp; It is a pretty easy to follow, worn path and there are
      orange ties on trees to keep you from getting lost.&nbsp; Follow this path
      for a few minutes until you reach a stream.&nbsp; Cross the stream and
      follow it all the way up until you see some pipes in a waterfall.&nbsp;
      You can collect your water here, although we recommend still purifying or
      using iodine tablets just to be safe.</p>

      <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling up to another hike, there is also a waterfall
      that you can hike to. Since we were only there overnight and we were tired
      from the hike in, we didn&rsquo;t go in search of the waterfall. We
      decided to relax and enjoy the sunset and sunrise from the beach.</p>

      <p>We definitely recommend spending 2-3 days in the valley.&nbsp; We only
      had time for an overnight trip and we wished we had more time in the
      valley to relax and recoup before we climbed back out! Enjoy your time in
      this secluded oasis, and remember to always pack out what you brought
      in!</p>
