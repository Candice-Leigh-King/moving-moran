      <h1><strong>Waipio Valley to Waimanu
      Valley</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to be far away
      from the crowds of Waipio Valley and experience the untouched beauty of
      Hawaii, then Waimanu Valley should be on your bucket list! Before the
      tsunami of 1949, Waimanu Valley was a thriving community of fishermen and
      farmers who lived off the land.&nbsp; Today, it is the most remote part of
      the island and is only accessible by foot or boat. This beautiful black
      sand beach is a must see for all those looking to escape the hustle and
      bustle of daily life.rum.</p>

      <h1><strong>What to expect:</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Immerse yourself
      in the magic that is the Waimanu Valley at this incredibly beautiful
      beachfront camping oasis. Before you begin you want to make sure you
      secure a campsite reservation at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,31720.html">Hawaii
      Camping</a>. You&rsquo;ll need to create an account and bring a copy of
      the permit reservation with you. (A screenshot on your phone is okay too!)
      A campsite will cost $18 a night and there is a primitive toilet at the
      site.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This hike technically starts at the top of the Waipio Valley.&nbsp; We
      planned on driving to the bottom of the hill and starting our hike at the
      beach, but the security guard cautioned us on leaving our car at the beach
      overnight saying it would be &ldquo;asking for trouble&rdquo;.&nbsp; We
      decided tacking on the extra 3 miles both ways was better than getting
      broken into and parked on the road before the Waipio Valley Overlook. We
      also heard that you can pay a fee to leave your car at the Waipio Valley
      Artworks for a few days, but since we found parking on the street we
      didn't need to pay.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If there&rsquo;s anything you take from this post it's to bring hiking
      poles on this trip! By starting at the top of Waipio Valley you will be
      hiking a total of 19 miles with three 3,500 foot climbs.&nbsp; So be
      prepared!&nbsp; Hopefully some kind soul will drive you up to the top on
      your way back out, but you can&rsquo;t count on it.&nbsp; Luckily, someone
      picked us up 3/4th of the way back up the hill, and I don&rsquo;t think I
      have ever been so thankful for a ride in my life! Check out our
      Backpacking guide here (link backpacking post) to know exactly what to
      pack for this overnight hike!</p>
