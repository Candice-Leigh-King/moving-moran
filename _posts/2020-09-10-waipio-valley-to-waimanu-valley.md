      <h1><strong>Waipio Valley to Waimanu
      Valley</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to be far away
      from the crowds of Waipio Valley and experience the untouched beauty of
      Hawaii, then Waimanu Valley should be on your bucket list! Before the
      tsunami of 1949, Waimanu Valley was a thriving community of fishermen and
      farmers who lived off the land.&nbsp; Today, it is the most remote part of
      the island and is only accessible by foot or boat. This beautiful black
      sand beach is a must see for all those looking to escape the hustle and
      bustle of daily life.rum.</p>

      <h1><strong>What to expect:</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Immerse yourself
      in the magic that is the Waimanu Valley at this incredibly beautiful
      beachfront camping oasis. Before you begin you want to make sure you
      secure a campsite reservation at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,31720.html">Hawaii
      Camping</a>. You&rsquo;ll need to create an account and bring a copy of
      the permit reservation with you. (A screenshot on your phone is okay too!)
      A campsite will cost $18 a night and there is a primitive toilet at the
      site.&nbsp;</p>
