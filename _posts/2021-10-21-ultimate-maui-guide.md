            <p>Want to travel Maui like a local?&nbsp; Well we&rsquo;ve got you
            covered!&nbsp; While we can&rsquo;t call ourselves locals, we did
            live in Maui for 6 months and know all the best places to hike,
            snorkel and eat!&nbsp; Maui is one of the most incredible places to
            visit with such diverse landscapes, your adventure options are truly
            endless.&nbsp; We recommend visiting for at least a week to truly
            get the Hawaiian experience.&nbsp;</p><p><em>* Hawaii is a special
            place with rich history and culture.&nbsp; Please be very respectful
            of the people and land while visiting, and always leave places
            better than you found it!</em></p><p>There is so much to see on the
            Island of Maui, so I will split it up into sections so that it's
            easier to digest.&nbsp; At the end of this post you can find a 10
            day itinerary to make the planning easier for you!</p>

            <h3><strong>North Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paia is
            dubbed the hippie town of Maui and it consists of cool shops, great
            places to eat and beautiful beaches.&nbsp; On Paia&rsquo;s main
            street you will find many shops filled with jewelry, beachwear and
            art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best
            Restaurants:</strong></h4><ul><li><p><em><strong>Mama&rsquo;s Fish
            house -</strong></em> Ready to drop some $$$ on the best meal of
            your life?&nbsp; Mama&rsquo;s Fish house is the best place to
            be.&nbsp; Great vibes and even better food, just make sure you get a
            reservation well in advance!</p></li><li><em><strong>Paia Fish
            Market-</strong> </em>The best fish tacos you will ever have!
            Perfect for a quick bite at any time of the day.&nbsp; There is also
            a location in Lahaina and Kihei if you can&rsquo;t get enough on
            your trip to Paia!</li><li><em><strong>Polli&rsquo;s Mexican
            Restaurant-</strong></em> Okay not technically in Paia, but its only
            a 10 min drive and so worth it for the best Mexican on the island!
            Its so authentic that you can expect to see waiters chasing the
            islands famous roosters out the door every few
            minutes!&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Ululani's Hawaiian Shaved
            ice-</strong></em> Maybe not exactly a meal but this tasty treat is
            a must while you&rsquo;re in Hawaii.&nbsp; Try flavors unique to
            Hawaii like lychee and Lilikoi with their incredible Mochi on top!
            There are many locations on the island and I&rsquo;m sure
            you&rsquo;ll need to get your fix more than once during your
            trip!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best
            Beaches:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Ho&rsquo;okipa
            -</strong></em> This is the perfect place to see turtles (Please
            keep at least a 10 foot distance between you and a turtle!&nbsp;
            It's actually illegal to touch or come close to turtles in Hawaii!)
            Also check out the overlook to watch surfers ride some pretty crazy
            waves!</li><li><em><strong>Baldwin Beach -</strong></em> Turquoise
            waters and absolutely incredible views of the lush mountains of the
            Central Coast! Also a great place to watch kite
            surfers!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best
            Shops:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Alice in HulaLand-
            </strong></em>This quirky shop has the best
            clothes!</li><li><em><strong>Ho&rsquo;okipa Surf- </strong></em>The
            best shirts!&nbsp; Matt got so many cool shirts and hats here that
            are great quality and colors!</li><li><em><strong>Tribe
            Maui-</strong></em> If you went to Polli's Mexican restaurant, make
            sure you stop in this store that's across the street. This boutique
            has my favorite unique jewelry and clothes!</li></ul>

            <h3><strong>East Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The famous
            road to Hana!&nbsp; If you have a 4x4 vehicle there are technically
            three ways to do the road to Hana.&nbsp; You can (1) start by Paia
            and go to Hana and back, (2) Start by Paia go all the way around and
            end up on the south side of Maui, or (3) start on the south side go
            to Hana and back.&nbsp; My personal favorite is the last option
            because I get pretty car sick, but if it's your first time you
            really should try to go all the way around to experience the full
            beauty of this ride!&nbsp; Note: rental cars do not insure you if
            you take the Southside way to Hana because you are mostly on a dirt
            road and it can get a little sketchy.&nbsp; We took our 2016 Jeep
            Grand Cherokee on the road many, many times and it handled the
            roads, and turns just fine! This road isn't for the faint of heart
            though with its many hair pin and cliffside turns.&nbsp; If you go
            slow and stay very aware of cars around you, you will be just fine!
            Also let locals pass, as they will be used to the roads and going
            much faster!</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re starting from Paia make sure to download the
            &ldquo;Road to Hana Maui GyPSy Guide'' in the app store.&nbsp; It
            tells you where to stop, how long each stop might be and gives you
            history along the way!&nbsp; It's about $5 and so worth it for all
            the information you get.&nbsp; There are so many turns it's easy to
            pass up some pretty incredible spots if you don't have it.&nbsp;
            Just make sure you download the app before you take the drive
            because you will lose service along the way.&nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>Road to Hana:</strong></h4><p>Some of our favorite
            places to stop along the way (in the order that you will
            pass):</p><ol><li><em><strong>Twin
            Falls</strong></em>&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Garden of Eden
            Arboretum</strong></em>&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Halfway to Hana

            waterfalls</li><li><em><strong>Pua&rsquo;a Ka&rsquo;a State Wayside
            Park-</strong></em> great place to have a picnic, use the restroom
            and enjoy another waterfall and swimming area.&nbsp;</li><li>There
            are too many waterfalls on this drive to name, so if you see
            something cool, safely pull over and check them
            out!</li><li><em><strong>Hana Lava Tube ( Mile Marker
            31)</strong></em> Turn Left on Ula&rsquo;ino road to check out the
            coolest lava tube!&nbsp; Make sure you bring your flash
            lights!</li></ol>

            <p><em><strong>9. Hana Town- </strong></em>as you can see this is a
            pretty extensive list, so if you can spend the night in Hana you can

            <p><em><strong>11. Venus Ponds- </strong></em>A must stop in my
            opininion! A short trail down to a secluded swimming area off of the
            ocean.&nbsp; You can cliff jump here and the water is clear and and
            so refreshing!</p>

            of the road in the many parking spaces.&nbsp; You can see the falls

            trail-</strong></em> My favorite hike on all of Maui!&nbsp; Do not
            miss this stop!&nbsp; Check out the pools and then go on this 4 mile
            hike to the 400 foot Waimoku Falls through an incredible bamboo
            forest.&nbsp; Trust me, its one of the coolest hikes Ive ever been

            <h3><strong>South Maui:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We lived
            in Kihei so we might be a little biased to this side, but there are
            so many amazing beaches and places to eat that we fell in
            love!</p><h4><strong>Best
            Restaurants:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Maui Brewing-
            </strong></em>Incredible beers with an amazing outdoor seating
            area.&nbsp; Try to come here at sunset!</li><li><em><strong>Isana-
            </strong></em>Our favorite sushi in the whole wide world! Please
            just do us a favor and go here.&nbsp; And don't forget a
            reservation! Check out Happy hour for 40% off select sushi and
            drinks from 3-5pm and 9-10pm daily.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>South
            Shore Tiki Bar-&nbsp; </strong></em>This was our favorite spot to
            hang out! Great tiki drinks and Pizza in a cute
            atmosphere!</li><li><em><strong>Food trucks off of Piikea
            Ave-</strong></em> A fun area to come if no one can decide on what
            they want.&nbsp; Come here and choose from several food trucks and
            then meet at the picnic tables as a family!</li><li><em><strong>5
            Palms- </strong></em>This is a more expensive dinner, but the views
            and food are worth it!&nbsp; Take a nice walk on the beach before or
            after dinner.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <h4><strong>Best Beaches:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Makena
            Beach (Big Beach) - </strong></em>If you make it to any beach on
            this side of the island, make it this one!&nbsp; Better yet come
            here for sunset and you will not be disappointed.&nbsp; Word from an
            over cautious nurse- the waves here are STRONG.&nbsp; Please never
            turn your back on the ocean and be careful while boogie boarding or
            body surfing.&nbsp; The waves are known to slam you into the beach
            and if you don't know what you're doing you could get very hurt or
            paralyzed.&nbsp; Trust me I saw it at the hospital.&nbsp; So just be
            smart and have fun!&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Little Beach (Nude
            Beach) -</strong></em> This is a fully nude beach that is incredibly
            beautiful, but if you're not into nudity do not venture over
            here.&nbsp; To get here from the big beach, go to the far right side
            (if you're looking at the ocean) and climb over the dividing
            rocks.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Makena Secret Cove-
            </strong></em>Not much of a secret anymore, and it shows because
            it's constantly packed!&nbsp; But if you can find a spot it's so
            worth it!</li><li><em><strong>Kamaole park I,II &amp;
            III-</strong></em> most locals have their favorite, check out all
            three and let me know your favorite!</li></ul>

            <h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>La Perouse
            Bay and Lava Field hike -</strong></em> Rent some snorkel gear from
            Snorkel Bob&rsquo;s in Kihei for the day and head out to La Perouse
            bay for some amazing snorkeling! You will see tons of fish and even
            some sea turtles! Always remember to wear Reef Safe sunscreen as we
            want to keep the reefs healthy and vibrant! Afterwards, head down
            the road a bit to the Lava Fields hike along the ocean.&nbsp; It's
            truly a unique experience!</li></ul>

            <ul><li><em><strong>Day trip to Molokini- </strong></em>There are so
            many options for half day or full day boat trips to the molokini
            crater.&nbsp; The snorkeling is incredible and it's so fun to sail
            around on a catamaran!&nbsp; If you have time for a longer trip, I
            suggest booking one that also goes to &ldquo;turtle
            town&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is the Mala Wharf on the Westside of Maui
            and you are guaranteed to see many turtles because the turtles come
            here to have fish eat the algae off their shells and flippers, kind
            of like a turtle car wash! You can start these trips from Maalaea
            Harbor or Lahaina Harbor.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            not even vegan.&nbsp; You have to get one of their acai

            <h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Honolua
            Bay- </strong></em>Walk through a literal fairytale land of banyan
            trees to a perfect snorkeling
            bay.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Dragon's Teeth- </strong></em>Nice
            half mile walk along the ocean to see a cool lava flow formation
            that looks like jagged dragon teeth! Parking for the hike is from a
            parking lot off of office road, next to the Maui Pineapple
            Chapel.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Surfing- </strong></em>This is a
            great area to try surfing for the first time.&nbsp; I do recommend
            starting with a trainer as surfing is hard to learn on your own and
            you don't want to take on waves that are too big for you!&nbsp;
            Launiupoko is a great place to learn! (pro tip: stay out of the way
            of other surfers if you don't want to get yelled at!) Another great
            area is anywhere along the Honoapiilani Highway past Olowala Beach
            area. Youll see people pulled over and surfing wherever they see
            waves!</li></ul>

            <ul><li><em><strong>Mala Wharf-</strong></em> If you opted out of
            taking a trip to Molokini, you can still reach &ldquo;turtle
            town&rdquo; by car! Park at the wharf and swim out to the sunken
            wharf to see turtles and coral!&nbsp; Caution: do not attempt this
            if you are not a strong swimmer!&nbsp; There is a decent current
            here and it's a little ways out to reach the coral! Take a life
            jacket or choose to snorkel with a tour if you are
            unsure.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <h3><strong>Central:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Iao
            Valley (Pronounced EE-ow) - </strong></em>This is a must stop for
            its beautiful scenery and interesting historical events.&nbsp; I
            suggest parking in the large parking lot at the very top of the hill
            and doing the short hike up to the viewpoint of the Iao
            needle.&nbsp; From there you can walk down the path to the river and
            if the water is calm you can lounge in the various pools that are
            created in the river.&nbsp; If you go back down to the parking lot,
            you will see many small paths cut into the trees where you can walk
            out to other calm pools.</li></ul>

            <ul><li><em><strong>Waihee Ridge trail- </strong></em>This is a 4
            Mile trail that offers gorgeous views of the ridge-line and the
            ocean.&nbsp; It is rated as hard due to its steep climb in some
            places. If you're not up to this milage, there is a viewpoint
            halfway that's absolutely breathtaking.</li></ul>

            <p>Driving on to Olivine Pools?&nbsp; Make sure you stop at Karen
            Lei&rsquo;s Gallery for beautiful gifts to take home to family and
            friends.&nbsp; There is local jewelry and other beautiful pieces of
            art to enjoy. If you forgot food there are also a few packaged
            snacks and drinks if you're in a pinch.&nbsp;</p>

            <ul><li><em><strong>Olivine Pools-</strong></em> *Please only visit
            if the ocean is calm, and never turn your back to the ocean!*&nbsp;
            People have been pulled out to the ocean and have even died here, so
            please use your common sense and do not go close if there are waves
            crashing into the pools. Even if it&rsquo;s a calm day, always face
            the ocean and stay away from the edges just in case. That being
            said, on calm days this is one of the coolest spots to see tide
            pools and jump into crystal clear pools carved out by the
            ocean.&nbsp; You are going to park in a red dirt area off the side
            of Kahekili Highway.&nbsp; It's best to type in &ldquo;Olivine
            Pools'' into google maps and be on the lookout for a dirt parking
            area.&nbsp; From the parking lot, take the short and steep hike down
            to the pools.&nbsp; There isn't a clear cut path, but you should
            usually see people down below and make your way towards them. The
            lava rock makes a very cool and beautiful landscape to view on the
            way down.&nbsp; Bring sturdy shoes and water shoes to change into as
            the rocks at the bottom will be slippery.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <ul><li><em><strong>Blow Hole- </strong></em>Once you've left the
            olivine pools continue up the road to the Nakalele BlowHole. Just as
            with the Olivine pools, please be very cautious near the edges and
            always respect the ocean!</li></ul>

            National Park - </strong></em>You&rsquo;re not going to want to miss
            this one of a kind experience.&nbsp; Make sure you book a sunrise
            reservation way in advance as it fills up quickly.&nbsp; I think
            it&rsquo;s so worth it to go for sunrise, although sunset is equally
            as beautiful if you are unable to get a reservation in time.
            Click&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            href="https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/facility/253731">here</a> to
            book a reservation.&nbsp; Make sure you bring a hat, gloves, and
            coat with you as it is around 40 degrees. Get to the lookout points
            early as they fill up and you want to have a great view of the sun
            peaking out throughout the clouds for the first time! If you have
            time after sunrise, hike the sliding sands trail for views that make
            you feel like you're on mars!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Best
            Restaurants:</strong></h4><ul><li><em><strong>Kula
            Bistro-</strong></em> All day cafe that has the best food and
            sweets! You're not going to want to miss out on their amazing case
            of baked goods&nbsp; filled with pies, cakes and other yummy
            treats.&nbsp; Trust me, if you&rsquo;re anything like me you will
            have trouble picking just one to take
            home!</li><li><em><strong>Bullies Burgers-</strong></em> Small shop
            on the way to Hana (If you're going the back way). They sell their
            all beef burgers from their cattle ranch and it is
            delicious!</li><li><em><strong>Maui Wine - </strong></em>Have you
            ever had pineapple wine?&nbsp; Try the pineapple flight here along
            with so many other delicious selections in a beautiful

            <p>**Driving around both ends of the island (Hana, and the opposite
            coast) are a little treacherous in areas.&nbsp; The roads are built
            on the side of cliffs so they might seem scary to some.&nbsp; I had
            absolutely no issues driving either of these roads, but just wanted
            to point out to you that they might seem scary if you&rsquo;re not
            used to driving tight, hilly roads. Go slow and pull off to the side
            to let any locals pass who might be pushing you past your comfort
            zone!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Check out rentals that offer roof
            top tents.&nbsp; That way you can have a car and a place to sleep
            all in one!</p>
