  This was an 11 mile hike through the desert to a waterfall oasis, so if you're
  packing for a colder trip make sure you factor in the extra weight of heavier

      <p>This is our packing list from our 3 night, 4 day backpacking trip to
      Havasupai.&nbsp; This was an 11 mile hike through the desert to a
      waterfall oasis, so if you're packing for a colder trip make sure you
      factor in the extra weight of heavier layers! Also, if you're hiking as a
      couple, notice that Matt always takes a heavier pack than I do because
      he's nice...and he knows I would take forever to make it up the mountain
      with that extra weight! Buying gear can be expensive up front, but once
      you have everything, it will last you forever!</p><p>We highly recommend
      heading in to REI to get sized for your hiking bag.&nbsp; Having a
      comfortable pack will make or break your trip, and with so many options
      out there it's best to try it before you buy it!&nbsp; I have an unusually
      short torso and after trying all the bags at the store, the Gregory pack
      size XS was the only one that fit me.&nbsp; Matt had a much easier time
      finding his though!</p>

      <h1><strong>What to expect:</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Immerse yourself
      in the magic that is the Waimanu Valley at this incredibly beautiful
      beachfront camping oasis. Before you begin you want to make sure you
      secure a campsite reservation at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,31720.html">Hawaii
      Camping.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to create an account and bring a
      copy of the permit reservation with you. (A screenshot on your phone is
      okay too!) A campsite will cost $18 a night and there is a primitive
      toilet at the site.&nbsp;</p>
